A C# console based recreation of Snake.
Use `dotnet run` to start. `BoardSize`, `MoveDelay` and `StartingBodySize` in `Program.cs` can all be modified to affect gameplay.

Console colours based on escape codes for windows command prompt terminal, not tested on other terminals.

To use the automatic solver, the board must be set to have an even side length, and you should run the program with `dotnet run auto`.
